The main directory for some of my works.
It is composed mostly of pixel art (spritesets and tilesets), music and some TTRPG stuff I've worked on in the past 6+ years I've been a Game Master.

I've started making music back in 2014, took several music theory and piano classes around 2018; I've been a pixel artist for around the same time.
Most of my work tends to look and sound pretty 'retro' as it is more of my personal style.
I've always taken the older MSâ€“DOS games as a reference to my own pixel art and music, however I tend to be pretty flexible.

Looking around my portfolio you'll probably several mentions of "Definitivus"; that's my main TTRPG campaign I've been running for more than 3 (almost 4) years.
I made all the maps, sprites, songs and even made my own houserules for the game; just thought it would be interesting to talk about in here and give some context.
The "Definitivus.html" file was made on the program 'Decker' by InternetJanitor.
